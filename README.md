# Telecom_Billing_System
With this project, we can perform and manage billing operations like they do in Telecom companies. Here, we can add records with name, phone number and the amount of payment. We can view, modify, search and delete existing records. We can also make payment by providing our phone number instead of name. All data added or modified are recorded in a file. This project will teach us how to add, list, edit, search and delete records using file handling.
